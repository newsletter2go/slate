# Introduction

The Newsletter Markup Language *NML* is the first and (as far as we know) only JSON/YAML based markup language optimized to generate bulletproof cross-client responsive emails.  

*NML* makes it easy for you as a developer to create beautiful emails without the hassle of coding like we're back in the nineties (yes, tables still rule html emails).  

*NML* is backed by [Newsletter2Go](https://www.newsletter2go.com/) and has been tested and optimized across [all major email clients](#email-client-support).
